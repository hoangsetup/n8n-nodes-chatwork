# n8n-nodes-chatwork
Provides n8n nodes to retrieve data from Chatwork API.

## If you have n8n installed: Install custom nodes module

Install it to the n8n root folder. This is the node_modules folder on the same level of n8n and n8n-core. This differs when you used the -g flag on n8n initial installation. From there do:
```
npm install n8n-nodes-chatwork
```
## Fresh install n8n

Navigate to desired folder, create a package json and install n8n like so:

```
cd /var/www/vhosts/

mkdir my-n8n && cd my-n8n

npm init --yes

npm install n8n

npm install n8n-nodes-chatwork
```
## Start n8n

Directly:
```
n8n
```

Plesk or C-Panel:
```
node /var/www/vhosts/n8n/bin/n8n
```

## Latest functionality

Xentral endpoints include endpoints of old and new API as well as the support for multiple databases.
